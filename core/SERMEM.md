SERMEM (or Serial Memory Interface)
===================================
A basic serial interface to the onboard memory on the Enterprise.  This class provides a mechanism by which the user can format, write and read the effects data stored in the Enterprise's onboard computer system.

*Note:* All data is transfered via the USB to Serial interface.  The default BAUD rate is 57.6k which seems to strike a good balance between speed and error rates.

# Writing data to the EEPROM
This sequence describes the process that a user should follow to write data to EEPROM.

## Command sequence
* Enter the appropriate mode (A for Auto, M for Manual).
    - Auto mode is best suited to a programmatic interface because messages from the Enterprise are suppressed and only status codes are returned
    - Auto mode is initiated by sending an 'A'
    - Manual mode is initiated by sending a 'M'
* Tell the Enterprise how much data you'll be sending.
    - Send a 'T' followed by the number of bytes, printed as string.  For example, to let the Enterprise know you'll be sending a 4K block, send the string "T4096".
* Start the Write process by sending a 'W'.
    - If the transfer size is invalid (0 or >256k) the Enterprise will respond with a message (if not in Auto mode) and an error code of 'E'.
* Start uploading the file data.  When complete the Enterprise will respond with 'N' (or NACK).

Here's the call sequence:

    Computer                                Enterprise
        A                                       A
        T{transfer size}                        A
        W                                       A
        {upload bytes}                          N
    (complete)

The Enterprise responds with single byte response codes.  'A' is ACK, 'N' is NACK, 'E' is error.


## Transfer Speeds
These are observed transfer speeds using a logic analyzer.

    Interface                   Rate                   Byte Transfer time
    ------------------------    -------------------    --------------------
    Serial/UART:                38.4K (BAUD)           234.5uS/byte
    I2C                         400K                   21.5uS/byte

    Math:
    UART: 1/38400 * 9 = 234.5mS   (8N1)
    I2C:  1/400000 * 9 = 22.5uS   (8 data + 1 for ack/nack)

### Leveraging transfer times between serial and I2C
The Sermem class takes advantage of the fact that the serial transfer speed is slower than both the I2C speed and the time the EEPROM chips take to write a page of data (about 5ms for the AT24C1024 EEPROM).  Here's how this works:

    At 38.4K, the time to write 256 bytes to the Enterprise is:
        234.5uS * 256 bytes = ~60mS for a full page of data.
    However, since a single byte can be transfered in 0.2mS, some caching is required to keep receiving data without interruption.  Here's a table listing cache bytes needed for various transfer speeds:
    Speed           Time per byte                           Bytes x-ferable in 5mS
    9600            1/9600 * 9      937.5uS                 5.333
    38400           1/38400 * 9     234.5uS                 21.3
    57600           1/57600 * 9     156.3uS                 32
    115200          1/115200 * 9     78.1uS                 64
    250000          1/250000 * 9     36.0uS                 139
        
> Note: For practical purposes, the buffer used for storing incoming serial data will be set 10 64 bytes.  This buffer will be used while the code detects that the EEPROM is still busy.  As soon as it's not busy, the code will begin draining the buffer to the EEPROM.
